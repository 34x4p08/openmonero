# JSON REST service for Monero

Example of using [restbed](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/) to
 provide Monero related JSON REST service. For this purpose, 
 a service called Open Monero was developed.

##  Open Monero 

Open Monero is an open source implementation of backend of
https://mymonero.com/. The frontend, which includes html, css, JavaScript were adapted
from (and originally developed by) https://mymonero.com/. 

Unlike MyMonero, Open Monero's backend is open sourced, free
to use, host and modify. Additionally, the following features were added/changed:

 - google analytics, cloudflare, images and flash were removed.
 - transaction fees were set to zero.
 - the wallets generated use 25 word mnemonics, fully compatible with official monero wallets
(13 word mnemonics generated by MyMonero work as usual though).
 - import wallet fee was reduced.
 - support of testnet network and wallets was added.
   
##  Status

Still under development as its not finished.

## Host it yourself

The Open Monero consists of four components that need to be setup for it to work:

 - MySql/Mariadb database - it stores user address (viewkey is not stored!), 
 associated transactions, outputs, inputs and transaction import payments information.
 - Frontend - it is virtually same as that of MyMonero, except before mentioned differences.
  It consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 - Monero daemon - daemon must be running and fully sync, as this is 
 where all transaction data is fetched from and used. Daemon also commits txs 
 from the Open Monero into the Monero network.
 - Backend - fully written in C++. It uses restbed to serve JSON REST to the frontend 
 and mysql++ to interface the database. It also accesses Monero blockchain and "talks"
 with Monero deamon.

## Scrap notes

### Generate your own ssl certificate 
 
Setting up https and ssl certificates in restbed
 - https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/blob/34187502642144ab9f749ab40f5cdbd8cb17a54a/example/https_service/source/example.cpp

Based on the link above:
 
```bash
# Create Certificate
cd /tmp
openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048
```

### Enable it in Firefox or Chrome

Firefox and chrome will not work with that certificate as they cant verify it. 
To overcome this for development purposes on localhost, just open new tab in the browser used
and go to any link from the service, e.g., `https://localhost:1984/login`. Once you do this,
you should get warring about unsecured or un verified certificate. Then you just add it manually
as exception.

Also Open Monero generates uses 25 word seeds, which are fully comptabilite with `monero-wallet-cli`
and `monero-core`.
 
### Test connection using curl

Example of curl https request to the service

```bash
curl -k -X POST -d '{"withCredentials":true,"address":"41pJD13rU5r3KZsxzS65tL9zLMpZZCer8aWSi7wj8Xm99BAgXthcj2wgazxdTX9auFAmp3czfJUGH2S3UJfLwDWXUxc3ooC","view_key":"06d1f0f0fd766c75b52b9c597592d06f4bca5cd6dcd3e9bf1859bc78d0d5f80e","create_account":true}' https://localhost:1984/login
```

### Compile mysql c++ connector 
```
git clone https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-cpp.git
cd mysql-connector-cpp && mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. -DBUILD_STATIC=1
make
```

## How can you help?

Constructive criticism, code and website edits are always good. They can be made through github.
